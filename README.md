# Predigame Examples

[Predigame](http://predigame.com) is a instructional platform for creating arcade games. Predigame came out our work at [Predicate Academy](http://predicate.us) where we have been teaching kids ages 8+ the fundaments of coding in seasonal classes that meet weekly for one hour.

Here are some common examples showcase the unique capabilities of the Predigame platform. This list is somewhat intentionally ordered with increasing complexity as some examples build on concepts covered in other tutorials.

- [Working with Sprites](sprites/) - how to draw shapes and images in the Predigame grid system
- [Fireworks!](fireworks/) - simple example that demonstrates sprites, effects, and timed callbacks.
- [Picture Frame](pictureframe/) - rotating picture display in full screen with optional clock.
- [Keeping Score](score/) - examples for how to add scoring boxes to a game
- [Thirsty Zombie](thirstyzombie/) - fun game where a zombie must drink "sprite" sprites to stay alive.
- [Drawing Mazes](mazes/) - examples for adding mazes to a game
- [Actors](actors/) - introduction to our *really cool* animated directional sprites.
- [Making Bacon](bacon/) - maze game with actors
- [Levels](levels/) - adding levels to a game
